# LibraryManagement
In this project, I've developed a straightforward yet functional library management system deployed as a canister on the Internet Computer (IC) platform, showcasing the capabilities of decentralized applications. Our system is designed to handle key library operations, including the management of book inventories and library members, as well as tracking the issuance and return of books. At its core, the system revolves around three main entities: books, with attributes like title, author, and availability; persons, representing library users; and transactions, recording the flow of books between the library and its users. Utilizing the IC's blockchain technology, we've ensured that all interactions with the system are transparent, secure, and decentralized. The system supports basic CRUD operations, allowing books to be added, issued, and returned, and their status updated in real time. This approach not only demonstrates the practical use of the IC for building and managing decentralized applications but also highlights how blockchain technology can revolutionize traditional library management by enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and reliability.
